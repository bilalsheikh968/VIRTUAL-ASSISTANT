# Shifra: My Virtual Assistant

Shifra is a simple yet effective virtual assistant built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed to provide an interactive and engaging experience, Shifra utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities to perform tasks based on user commands. With a user-friendly interface and responsive design, Shifra makes daily tasks easier, whether it's checking the time, opening websites, or providing information.


## Benefits

 - (Voice Interaction), Users can communicate with Shifra using voice commands, making the interaction hands-free and more natural.

## How It Works

APIs Used

- Web Speech API:

    - Speech Recognition: This allows the assistant to listen for and recognize user voice commands. The SpeechRecognition interface enables real-time voice input, which is processed to execute the desired actions.
    - Speech Synthesis: This converts text to speech, allowing Shifra to respond to users audibly. The SpeechSynthesisUtterance object is used to create and control speech output.


## How It Was Made

- HTML Structure: The HTML code provides the basic structure of the web page, including elements such as the logo, header, and buttons.

- CSS Styling: The CSS enhances the visual appeal of the assistant, using modern design techniques such as flexbox for layout and gradients for button backgrounds.

- ### JavaScript Functionality:
- The JavaScript code implements the speech recognition and synthesis features, allowing Shifra to listen for commands and respond accordingly.
- It initializes the speech recognition service, handles various commands (like opening websites, providing time and date), and updates the UI based on user interaction.
